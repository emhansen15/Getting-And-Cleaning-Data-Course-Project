# Getting-And-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this script is to gather all the provided acceleromter data and arrange it into a tiny data set.

##The script requires the unzipped "UCI HAR Dataset" folder to be in your working directory

The aformentioned folder contains two data sets, a "test" and a "train" data set. The "run_analysis.R" script merges the two datasets and labels each column based on the type of measurement it provides.
